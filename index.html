The biggest name is Philips with its Hue bulbs, but now IKEA, Hive and a whole host of others have got in on the act too.
Smart lighting is lighting that you can control from an app, usually on your Apple or Android phone.</p>
          <p class="bold">What is smart lighting?</p>
<p>The app enables you to change the brightness of the bulbs, and if the bulbs have coloured LEDs you can change their colours too. That opens up a whole world of possibilities, which you might call light recipes: you might have one light recipe for watching movies, another for dinnertime, and yet another for reading. Switching from one recipe to another is as simple as tapping a smartphone or yelling at your favourite voice-activated personal assistant.</p>
           <p class="bold">Smart lights with smart assistants</p>

<p>Smart lighting systems aren’t just controllable with smartphone or tablet apps. Philips’ Hue system works with Apple’s HomeKit, Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, and that means you can use those platforms’ voice assistants to relay your voice commands. There’s something undeniably cool about saying “Hey Siri, set scene to cinema” or “Alexa, turn the lights off” and seeing it happen.</p>

          <p class="bold">Early Thermostat Innovations</p>
<p>With the Industrial Revolution and later technological advances in the 20th century, it became possible to heat and cool buildings and homes in an effective way. The invention of the electric thermostat in 1883 revolutionized the concept of temperature control, and although the first designs were created to regulate the temperature of chicken incubators, the electric thermostat was here to stay and would soon become incorporated into indoor heating and cooling systems around the world.

The first electric thermostats were essentially single-function devices that allowed for a specific temperature to be maintained with a fair degree of accuracy. You might think that thermostats capable of doing more than that would be a far later development, but amazingly, the first programmable electric thermostat was invented over 100 years ago.

In 1906, the Electric Heat Regulator Company, today known as Honeywell, introduced the very first programmable thermostat called the Jewell. This simple, yet innovative, device was based on a clock and allowed the user to set a cooler temperature at night that would automatically be raised to a higher temperature by the clock the next morning.

The 20th century saw many more advances in thermostat technology. The programming capabilities became more and more elaborate, and the functions became more comprehensive. By the 1980s, it was possible to set different temperatures for different days and different times of the day, and by the 2000s, thermostats were commonly using touchscreen technology.</p>

<p class="bold">Smart Thermostats Arrive</p>
<p>In 2007, the first truly "smart" thermostat was introduced by a company called Ecobee. Created by venture capitalist and engineer Stuart Lombard, this was the very first thermostat in history to offer Wi-Fi connectivity. The idea revolutionized the thermostat world and established Ecobee as a first-to-market industry leader.

Competitors, however, were not far behind. Lombard's Ecobee soon found itself up against a new smart home thermostat manufacturer, Nest. Founded by former Apple engineers Tony Fedele and Matt Rogers, the startup quickly launched itself into the spotlight as tech reviewers gushed over the sleek, modern design of the Nest thermostat, as well as its innovative "learning" capabilities that allow the device to adjust temperature and energy usage based on owner preferences and energy costs.

Next, thermostat manufacturing behemoth Honeywell threw its hat into the ring with a line of several different Wi-Fi capable smart home thermostats. Ecobee and Nest swiftly followed their initial releases with updated devices boasting even more comprehensive features in order to keep up with the near constant technological advances in the market.</p>

Recently Google unveiled its new google nest hub in association with Nest, one of the big companies involved in home automation services. 

Along with all the attractive functionalities it brings with itself, it has a new feature of giving personalised routines for everyone in the house.

For this to work, it saves the voices of every house member. 

This can be used as a security system as well.

while no-one is at home it listens for voices even then, so if it detects a voice it hasn't heard before, it sends a message to the owner of the house and the owner of the house can view the live feed of the house with the inbuilt camera in the nest hub giving complete control of the security of the house to the owner being outside of the house.</p>
